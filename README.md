# AGM Codex Onboarding

A public, credential-free Codex marketplace and protected onboarding hub for AGM staff. Administrators assign role templates; staff run one installer and receive only their approved plugins, MCPs, CLIs, APIs, account scopes, and next login steps.

## Pilot

- Administrator: Stevie (`stevie@agmagency.com`)
- Staff tester: Jean (`jean@agmagency.com`)
- Meta Ads: shared, server-brokered, read-only account listing and campaign reporting
- Higgsfield: official local CLI plus four official Codex skills, authenticated on the employee's computer
- Staff access: database-managed invitations; no shared ChatGPT Business workspace is required

## Install

Mac:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roger-Roger-StevieAI/agm-codex-onboarding/main/install/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roger-Roger-StevieAI/agm-codex-onboarding/main/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers:

1. Detect Codex and provide the official installation path if it is missing.
2. Add the public AGM marketplace and install the AGM onboarding plugin.
3. Install the official Higgsfield CLI when needed.
4. Copy the four official Higgsfield skills into durable Codex storage.
5. Verify the plugin and CLI, complete local Higgsfield login, and offer one inexpensive test image.
6. Report success or the exact remaining login/verification step.

The scripts contain no AGM credentials. Review them before running: [Mac installer](install/install.sh) and [Windows installer](install/install.ps1).

## Hub capabilities

Staff-facing MCP tools:

- `hub_get_my_setup`
- `hub_list_assigned_connections`
- `hub_request_connection`
- `hub_get_request_status`
- `hub_test_connection`

Read-only Meta tools:

- `meta_list_ad_accounts`
- `meta_get_campaign_insights`

The dashboard lets Stevie assign templates, approve or deny requests, revoke or restore staff, inspect installation reports, and review the onboarding audit trail. Deactivated members fail every dashboard, API, and MCP authorization check immediately.

## Required Meta activation

The code is ready, but live Meta verification requires AGM's external authorization:

1. Create an AGM Meta developer app.
2. Configure its OAuth client in a Composio Meta Ads auth configuration.
3. Authorize the AGM administrator connection and verify the expected Meta Business ad accounts.
4. Add the following server-only Sites environment variables:
   - `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`
   - `COMPOSIO_META_CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - `COMPOSIO_META_TOOLKIT_VERSION` (optional)
5. Use the hub's Meta test. It can only list ad accounts and retrieve a bounded campaign-insights sample.

Never put those values in this repository, an installer, a dashboard field, a log, or an MCP response.

## Local development

Node.js 22.13 or newer and pnpm are required.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm test
```

The local dashboard is `http://localhost:3000`; its MCP endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. The hosted hub is [agm-connection-hub.stevie926063.chatgpt.site](https://agm-connection-hub.stevie926063.chatgpt.site).
